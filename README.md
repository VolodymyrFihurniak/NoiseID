### DYNAMIC AUTHENTICATION OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES BY INTERNAL ELECTRICAL NOISE

1. A method of authentication of electronic devices has been developed that differs from the known method of frequency identification by using bit and amplitude patterns formed from sequences of discrete values of the autocorrelation function of internal electrical noise, which made it possible to reduce the false negative error by half and simplify the calculation of patterns.
2. A method for authenticating electronic devices with low noise levels is proposed, which is characterized by the use of a group identification feature - a peak pattern formed from a sequence of much fewer discrete values of the autocorrelation function of noise, which made it possible to reduce the size of the pattern by at least102 times.
3. A method for authenticating pseudorandom sequence generators that differs from known analogs by comparing the shapes of correlograms, which allows identifying generators.
4. A method for estimating concentrated narrowband interference with random frequency is developed, which consists in applying the form factor of the histogram of the distribution of values of the autocorrelation function of noise with interference, which makes it possible to detect noise records with interference for their rejection. The method does not require determining the frequency of the interference and thus differs from known analogs.
